description: Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, working at the intersection of psychology, economics, and political science. I am interested in the formation and the effects of political and economic beliefs, such as beliefs about election fraud, social mobility, or how financial markets work. Most of my current thinking centers around the question “what makes information persuasive?” 

  I hold a BSc in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from University College London and a Master of Behavioral and Decision Science from the University of Pennsylvania. Most recently, I worked as a Behavioral Economist at the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, where I ran online experiments on financial decision-making. 
  
  I am originally from Austria and love to travel and try food around the world. Music also plays an important role in my life.
